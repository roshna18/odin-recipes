# Odin Recipes

This is my first project for The Odin Project's Foundations course.  
In this project, Iâ€™ll build a basic recipe website using only HTML.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Basic Git and GitHub usage
- Setting up and cloning a remote repository
- Writing clean and semantic HTML
- Structuring multiple HTML pages
- Linking between pages using anchor tags
- Using lists, images, and text content

Once completed, this will serve as a solid foundation for all future web development projects.
